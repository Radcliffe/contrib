Hello and welcome to the contrib application process! We're happy to have you :)

Before we begin, please note these 3 requirements for new contrib projects:

- [ ] Include a README.md file containing license and maintainer information.
- [ ] Include a LICENSE.txt file.
- [ ] If porting a Drupal 7 project, Maintain the Git history from Drupal.

When your project meets those three criteria, please continue with the following:


**The name of your module, theme, or layout**
Forum Access

**(Optional) Post a link here to an issue in the drupal.org queue notifying Drupal 7 maintainers that you are working on a Backdrop port of their project**
https://www.drupal.org/project/forum_access/issues/3070491

**OR (option #2) If you have contributed code to Backdrop core/contrib projects please provide links to pull requests/commits**

**OR (option #3) If you do not intend to contribute code, but would like to update documentation, manage issue queues, etc, please tag an existing contrib group member so they can post their recommendation**
[@USERNAME]

**If you have chosen option #3 above, do you agree to undergo the same review process for coders (above) should you ever decide to contribute code?**
YES/no

**If you have chosen option #2 or #1 above, do you agree to the [Backdrop Contributed Project Agreement](https://github.com/backdrop-ops/contrib#backdrop-contributed-project-agreement)**
YES/no

**Post a link to your new Backdrop project under your own GitHub account**
https://github.com/jenlampton/forum_access

Once we have a chance to review your project, we may provide feedback that's meant to be helpful. If everything checks out, you will be invited to the @backdrop-contrib group, and will be able to transfer the project  ðŸ˜‰
